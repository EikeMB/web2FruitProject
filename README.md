# web2FruitProject

### Description
A web application that has a collection of fruits. Users must sign in and can then review the fruits and look at the review of others.

This project was a school project that I did with another person for a web programming class. The inspiration for it came about when me and the other person would always argue about what fruits were the best.

### Technologies used
This web app was made using node.js for the server side, mongoDb for the database, and React for the frontend.


### How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the node.js server
3. Run the react project
4. Open the site
